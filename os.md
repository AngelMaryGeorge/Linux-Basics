# Operating Systems
An Operating System (OS) is a collection of software that manages computer hardware resources and provides common services for computer programs. 
When you start using a Computer System then it's the Operating System (OS) which acts as an interface between you and the computer hardware. 
The operating system is really a low level Software which is categorised as a System Software and supports a computer's basic functions, such as memory management, tasks scheduling and controlling peripherals etc.

## What is Operating System?
An Operating System (OS) is an interface between a computer user and computer hardware. 
An operating system is a software which performs all the basic tasks like file management, memory management, process management, handling input and output, and controlling peripheral devices such as disk drives and printers.

Generally, a Computer System consists of the following components:

Computer Users are the users who use the overall computer system.
Application Softwares are the softwares which users use directly to perform different activities. These softwares are simple and easy to use like Browsers, Word, Excel, different Editors, Games etc. These are usually written in high-level languages, such as Python, Java and C++.
System Softwares are the softwares which are more complex in nature and they are more near to computer hardware. These software are usually written in low-level languages like assembly language and includes Operating Systems (Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux), Compiler, and Assembler etc.
Computer Hardware includes Monitor, Keyboard, CPU, Disks, Memory, etc.

## Operating System - Examples
There are plenty of Operating Systems available in the market which include paid and unpaid (Open Source). 
Following are the examples of the few most popular Operating Systems:
### Windows: 
This is one of the most popular and commercial operating systems developed and marketed by Microsoft. It has different versions in the market like Windows 8, Windows 10 etc and most of them are paid.

Some other old but popular Operating Systems include Solaris, VMS, OS/400, AIX, z/OS, etc.
